# uSystolic
This is an architecture-aware systolic array simulator, which generates cycle-accurate traces to evaluate 
1) the latency for GEMM execution
2) the bandwidth for memory accesses
3) the power and energy consumption, including both computing kernels and memory hierarchies

## uSystolic Features
### weight-stationary dataflow
### cycle-accurate trace generation
### multi-cycle MAC execution
### varying-byte data word
