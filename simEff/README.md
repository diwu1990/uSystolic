The effifiency simulation of *uSystolic-Sim* reports the energy and power consumption for both the computing kernel and memory hierarchy.

The energy and power numbers for the computing kernel are generated by a customized analytical model, while those for the memory hierarchy are reported by [CACTI 7.0](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/cacti7/) using the run-time statistics generated in the hardware simulation.
