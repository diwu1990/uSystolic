The effifiency simulation of *uSystolic-Sim* reports the power and energy consumption for both the computing kernel and memory hierarchy.

The power and energy numbers for the computing kernel are generated by a customized analytical model, while those for the memory hierarchy are reported by [CACTI 7.0](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/cacti7/) using the runtime statistics generated in the hardware simulation.
