The hardware simulation of *uSystolic-Sim* reports the power and energy consumption for both the computing kernel and memory hierarchy.

The power and energy numbers for the computing kernel are generated by a customized analytical model, while those for the memory hierarchy are reported by CACTI6.3 using the trace files generated in the architecture simulation.
