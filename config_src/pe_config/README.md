An example '''pe.cfg''' file is [here](https://github.com/diwu1990/uSystolic-Sim/blob/main/synthesis/32nm_rvt/8bit/pe.cfg).

This file is pre-generated, and will be automatically copy to the config folder.

The '''Frequency''' field indicates the synthesis frequency, while an additonal field '''Running Frequency''' can be added for the actual running frequency.
Both fields require a unit of '''MHz'''.
