# uSystolic
This is an architecture-aware systolic array simulator, which generates cycle-accurate traces to evaluate 
1) latency for GEMM execution
2) bandwidth for memory access
3) power and energy for both computing kernels and memory hierarchies

## Feature
uSystolic is featured by 
### weight-stationary dataflow
### cycle-accurate trace generation
### multi-cycle MAC execution
### varying-byte data word
